Kulakov Research Center for Obstetrics, Gynecology and Perinatology	Department of System Biology in Reproduction	Chagovets	Vitaliy	vvchagovets@gmail.com	2016-08-04	The chemical sensitivity of urine metabolomics analysis is greatly compromised due to the large amounts of inorganic salts in urine NaCl KCl which are detrimental to analytical instrumentation e g chromatographic columns or mass spectrometers Traditional desalting approaches applied to urine pretreatment suffer from the chemical losses which reduce the information depth of analysis We aimed to test a simple approach for the simultaneous preconcentration and desalting of organic solutes in urine based on the collection of induced bursting bubble aerosols above the surface of urine samples Bursting bubbles were generated at ambient conditions by feeding gas through an air diffuser at the bottom of diluted 200 times in ultrapure water urine solution 50 500 mL Collected aerosols were analyzed by the direct infusion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry ESI MS The simultaneous preconcentration ca 6 12 fold and desalting ca 6 10 fold of organic solutes in urine was achieved by the bursting bubble sample pretreatment which allowed ca 3 times higher number of identified urine metabolites by high resolution MS analysis No notable chemical discrimination effects were observed The increased degree of MS data clustering was demonstrated on the principal component analysis of data sets from the urine of healthy people and from the urine people with renal insufficiency At least 10 times higher sensitivity of trace drug detection in urine was demonstrated for clenbuterol and salbutamol Our results indicate the high versatility of bubble bursting as a simple pretreatment approach to enhance the chemical depth and sensitivity of urine analysis 	Homo sapiens	+7916919146	Sample Treatment	4

Department of Internal Medicine	Takis	Panteleimon	takis@giottobiotech.com	2018-09-15	We studied 64 patients admitted to the Florence main hospital emergency room with severe abdominal pain A blood sample was drawn from each patient at admission and the corresponding sera underwent 1H NMR metabolomics fingerprinting Unsupervised PCA analysis showed a significant discrimination between a group of patients with symptoms of upper abdominal pain and a second group consisting of patients with diffuse abdominal intestinal pain Prompted by this observation supervised statistical analysis OPLS DA showed a very good discrimination 90 between the two groups of symptoms Actually in the present study upper abdominal pain may result from either symptomatic gallstones cholecystitis or pancreatitis while diffuse abdominal intestinal pain may result from either intestinal ischemia strangulated obstruction or mechanical obstruction Although limited by the small number of samples from each of these six conditions discrimination of these diseases was attempted In the first symptom group 70 discrimination accuracy was obtained among symptomatic gallstones pancreatitis and cholecystitis while for the second symptom group 85 classification accuracy was obtained for intestinal ischemia strangulated obstruction and mechanical obstruction No single metabolite stands up as a possible biomarker for any of these diseases while the contribution of the whole 1H NMR serum fingerprint seems to be a promising candidate to be confirmed on larger cohorts as a first line discriminator for these diseases 	Homo sapiens	+393423233750	Abdominal pain location (symptom)|clinical diagnosis	64
